Some points for myself.
1. Use excel or similar stuffs for understanding to solve data problems and then apply business logic
2. The metadata of the table needs to be modified accordingly if we are to add extra columns or change the column type. so update the table creation script too
3. the bulk update needs to be used with sourcee file
4. use GO for separating
5. use procedures so that repetitive tasks wil be skipped
6. use try catch and getdatefor better logging of errors
